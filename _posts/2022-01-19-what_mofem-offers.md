<!-- MoFEM (Mesh-oriented Finite Element Method) is a `C++` library for managing complexities related to the finite element method (FEM). FEM is a widely used numerical approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in various physical problems. `MoFEM` is developed to provide a finite element library incorporating modern approximation approaches and data structures for engineers, students and academics.


`MoFEM` is an advanced open-source Finite Element (FE) libraries. The catalyst for the creation of `MoFEM` was the need for a flexible and numerically accurate modelling environment for multi-physics problems posed by our partners, including industry (EDF Energy, Jacobs, Advanced Forming Research Centre, etc).

`MoFEM` delivers a software development platform that enhances scientific innovation by providing a flexible and adaptable modelling framework, using novel disruptive approaches to long-standing problems in continuum mechanics and tackling conflicting requirements of accuracy and computational efficiency. This is achieved in `MoFEM` by developing and adopting state-of-the-art FE technologies, for example, H1-, H(curl)-, H(div)- and L2-conforming finite elements equipped with hierarchical, heterogeneous, and anisotropic approximation bases; error-driven hp-adaptivity; mesh topology evolution. In addition, `MoFEM`’s HPC capabilities are supported by its unique data structures capable of handling generic multi-field, multi-physics and multi-scale problems.


Therefore, `MoFEM` provides users with an effective tool for solving Partial Differential Equations arising in various fields of Engineering and Applied Physics: solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, soft matter physics, heat transfer, electromagnetism etc. Furthermore, `MoFEM` features an extendable modular design: while its open-source core library is developed to manage the complexities of FEM, additional user modules are devoted to particular applications. Such a toolkit-like structure allows for independent development of modules with different repositories, owners and licences.

An extensive list of features can be found under <a">this link </a>.

Installation, functionality and documentation of `MoFEM` were independently verified by five open reviewers to satisfy the standards of the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01441).
