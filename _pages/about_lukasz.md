### **Prof ≈Åukasz Kaczmarczyk**

I am a co-founder and `Technical Director` of **Mesh-Oriented Solutions** and a `Professor` of Applied Computational Modeling at the `University of Glasgow` in the `Glasgow Computational Engineering Centre`. I have nearly two decades of experience developing code for industrial applications. My software solutions are used by EDF and Jacobs for structural integrity problems in aggressive nuclear reactor environments. I also provide finite element technology solutions, working with companies such as Rolls-Royce, Siemens, and Freudenberg, on modeling wide range of industrial processes.
I designed `MoFEM`, a unique finite element system that utilises emerging finite element technologies in industrial applications. `MoFEM` is developed to shorten the time between innovation and real-world application, providing the flexibility of research code while being tested and validated to comply with rigorous industrial standards.
