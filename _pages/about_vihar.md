### **Prof Vihar Georgiev**

I am a [Professor of Nanoelectronics,](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/vihargeorgiev/) the leader of the [DeepNano Group](https://deepnano.org/) at the University of Glasgow and [an EPSRC UKRI Innovation Fellow](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/S001131/1). My group is part of [Glasgow Computational Engineering Centre (GCEC).](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gcec/) The aim of the group is to continue the research in modeling and simulations areas of electronic devices by combining not only analytical and numerical approaches but also machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. The DeepNano Group research activities are focused on the modelling and simulation of nanoscale devices for advanced optoelectronics, biosensors and quantum applications. I have more than 15 years of experience of developing [numerical solvers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10825-020-01519-0) and [machine learning methods](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8779691) that are used for modelling and simulations of various semiconductor devices, such as [nanowire transistors,](https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/136313/)[tunnelling FETs](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/abd125), [molecular flash memories](https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/100435/) and [bio-sensors](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/devmod/research/biosensors/) not only on [IV](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/abacf3) and [III-V semiconductor](https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/269630/) but also [molecules](https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/233110/), [carbon nanotubes](http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/159398/) and [Josephson’s junctions](https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/267379/).
