### **Dr Karol** Lewandowski

<!-- I am a Research Associate and a member of EPSRC-supported Glasgow Computational Engineering Centre ([GCEC](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gcec/)). Currently, I am working as PDRA in an [EPSRC project](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/T008415/1) on predictive modelling of Incremental Cold Flow Forming (ICFF).

My PhD project, supported by [Lord Kelvin and Adam Smith Scholarship](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/ourresearchenvironment/prs/kelvinsmith/previouslyawardedkelvinsmithphdscholarships/201415projects/#d.en.359938,investigationoftheboneadaptationandfractureinthethirdmetacarpal(mciii)boneofthoroughbredracehorses-karollewandowski(lkasphdcandidate)), was focused on computational methods to predict and prevent musculoskeletal injury and fatality in the Thoroughbred racehorse. 

My main interests are: `computational mechanics`, `additive manufacturing` technology, `virtual and augmented reality` scientific visualisation and sustainable `research code development` (mostly `C++`). 

I am a senior developer of finite element library at the [MoFEM](https://mofem.eng.gla.ac.uk/) team. -->


As a `Research Software Engineer` and a co-founder of **Mesh-Oriented Solutions**, I combine deep academic knowledge with extensive professional software development experience. My journey in `finite element` analysis began with a PhD at the `University of Glasgow`, leading to the co-development of [MoFEM](https://mofem.eng.gla.ac.uk).

My contributions include numerical frameworks utilized in various fields, including `biomechanics`, `nuclear energy` and `manufacturing` and more. Skilled in crafting powerful `Finite Element Method` codes, primarily using modern `C++`, I also leverage modern development tools and methodologies for optimal efficiency and scalability.

My commitment is to provide innovative and effective numerical solutions, ensuring they meet the diverse and demanding needs. For a detailed overview of my professional background and project experience, please feel free to download my [Curriculum Vitae](/assets/pdf/Lewandowski_CVs.pdf).
