### **Dr Andrei** Shvarts

I am the `Scientific Director` of **Mesh-Oriented Solutions**, a `Lecturer` (Assistant Professor) at the James Watt School of Engineering, `University of Glasgow`, and an academic member of the Glasgow Computational Engineering Centre. 

After earning an MSc in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (2014) from St. Petersburg Polytechnic University (alma mater of Boris Galerkin), I obtained a PhD in Computational Mechanics from `École des Mines de Paris`, receiving two national prizes for the best PhD in France (2019). I began contributing to `MoFEM` during my postdoc at the University of Glasgow, focusing on modelling fracture in graphite bricks of nuclear power plants in collaboration with EDF Energy (2019–2021). 

In my current academic role, I lead projects developing and applying advanced simulation tools powered by `MoFEM` across structural, mechanical, electrical, and biomedical engineering. My work centres on novel, disruptive approaches to numerical modelling in engineering and applied physics, with a focus on industrial applications. My experience in developing `MoFEM` and supervising research and industry projects forms the foundation for my role as the Scientific Director of `MOS`.
