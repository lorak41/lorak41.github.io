### **Dr Andrei** Shvarts

I am a co-founder and `Scientific Director` of **Mesh-Oriented Solutions**, and I also hold a `Lecturer` (Assistant Professor) position at the James Watt School of Engineering, `University of Glasgow`. Additionally, I am an academic member of the Glasgow Computational Engineering Centre. 

After earning an MSc in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (2014) from St. Petersburg Polytechnic University (alma mater of Boris Galerkin), I obtained a PhD in Computational Mechanics from `École des Mines de Paris`, receiving two national prizes for the best PhD in France (2019). I began contributing to `MoFEM` during my postdoc at the University of Glasgow, focusing on modelling fracture in graphite bricks of nuclear power plants in collaboration with EDF Energy (2019–2021). 

In my current academic role, I lead projects developing and applying advanced simulation tools powered by `MoFEM` across structural, mechanical, electrical, and biomedical engineering. My work centres on novel, disruptive approaches to numerical modelling in engineering and applied physics, with a focus on industrial applications. My experience in developing `MoFEM` and supervising research and industry projects forms the foundation for my role as the Scientific Director of `MOS`.
