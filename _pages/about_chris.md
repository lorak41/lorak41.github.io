### **Prof Chris Pearce**

I am a `co-founder` and `Director` of Mesh-Oriented Solutions and `Professor of Computational Mechanics` at the University of Glasgow, where I am also Director of the `Glasgow Computational Engineering Centre` and currently `Vice-principal` for Research & Knowledge Exchange. Iâ€™m a `Chartered Engineer` and Fellow of the `Institution of Civil Engineers`. I have a 30 years experience of computational engineering research, focusing on modelling complex material behaviour and multi-physics problems, and have applied these techniques to various fields, including Civil, Nuclear, Manufacturing, and Biomedical Engineering. I have an established track record of knowledge transfer and I have addressed critical, life-limiting structural integrity issues.
