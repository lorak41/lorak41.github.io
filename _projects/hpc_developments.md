## High-Performance Computing (HPC) Optimized Solvers in MoFEM

At MoFEM, significant effort is devoted to implementing algorithms that solve multi-physics problems for solving large scale complex problems. These are essential for creating `scalable solvers` that maximize `HPC resources efficiency`, an imperative for the upcoming exascale computing era. The block structure of MoFEM facilitates the use of `scalable Krylov solvers` and `off-the-shelf scalable preconditioners` such as multigrid, additive Schwarz method, and block-Jacobi, among others.

The `generic data structures` in MoFEM are tailored to power `efficient block solvers`, providing practical, hands-on examples to tackle real-world problems.

MoFEM's versatility also extends to the integration of `GPU accelerators`, allowing for:

- `Matrix-free methods` that significantly reduce memory bandwidth while increasing floating point operations (FLOPs).
- An architecture that aligns with modern HPC infrastructures, especially those utilizing `accelerated hardware`.
- A cost-effective computation per degree of freedom (DoF) by combining `matrix-free and high-order methods`, surpassing traditional low-order methods.

A `pilot study` demonstrated considerable promise, particularly in problem classes that benefit from matrix-free methods like `multifield plasticity`.
