In the world of industrial applications, `butterfly valves` are essential for `controlling flow`. However, they face challenges such as `seal deformation` and maintaining `structural integrity` under varying operating conditions.

At `Mesh-Oriented Solutions`, we are developing `fully automated, highly scalable pipelines` for `structural mechanics simulations`—such as those of a butterfly valve—which involve `contact` and `large deformation` of `rubber materials`.

Here’s how we tackled a butterfly valve. Starting from raw `CAD geometry`, we:

* Generate `high-order tetrahedral meshes` with minimal preprocessing
* Solve using an `implicit, mixed formulation`
* Perform `automatic contact detection` with no manual setup
* Achieve `excellent parallel scalability`
* Enable `end-to-end design automation` for rapid iteration

By accurately modelling the valve’s behaviour, we can:

* `Optimise seal performance` to prevent leaks and extend lifespan
* `Analyse structural stresses` to ensure reliability under extreme conditions
* `Derive optimal valve designs` that minimise torque and wear while ensuring safe shut-off

These simulations not only `reduce prototyping costs`—they also `drive innovation` in valve design, ensuring `safety` and `efficiency` in `critical applications`.
